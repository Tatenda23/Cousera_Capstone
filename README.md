Title for the project: Finding the best location for  a New Restaurant using Foursquare API.

The main objective of the project was to find a location for an Italian restaurant in New York City, using Foursquare API.
The most populated borough, Brooklyn was used for analysis.
 All restaurants were grouped into three clusters using k-means clustering and each cluster was analyzed. 
This approach alongside others, such as finding distance of each venue from the central position in a neighborhood,
considering other factors such as age groups of inhabitants, nationalities, etc can be used to find the location for a new restaurant.
Foursquare data and a machine algorithm were successfully used to determine the location of a new Italian Restaurant.
Population data for each borough in New York City was obtained at data.beta.nyc (2019).
Geographical borough information  was obtained at https://cocl.us/new_york_dataset.
Python and its machine learning libraries were used to develop this project. The project was run on a Jupyter Notebook Server.
